            <h3>About Me</h3>
            <p id = "about_me_para">Hi, I am Tiffany Ho!  I attend <a href = http://www.sanmarinohs.org>San Marino High School</a> and am currently a rising senior.  My primary interests are computer science and video games.  I was introduced to the world of coding by a friend and my interest in coding only continued to grow since.  Shortly after, I discovered that my school had a newly founded Girls Who Code club.  I was in the club for two years and heard about a Girls Who Code summer immersion program through the club, so I applied, and here I am now!  I also took an introduction to coding class at my school, as I am an aspiring computer scientist. </p>
